# It's getting hot in here - Climate Change in Numbers
This repository contains plots for visualisation project for Advanced Visualisation in R classes for winter semester of 2022. Project is set on visualising climate change through numbers of human contribution. Data sources are listed below. 

# To-Do list:
0) [x] Gather data for plots
0) [ ] Opening slide word cloud that spells "Climate change"
1) [x] Land and ocean temperature plots
2) [x] Heat map of difference of global land and ocean temperatures from the mean
3) [x] World map with total CO2 emissions by country
4) [x] Barplot of biggest polluter countries in 2021
5) [x] Barplot of biggest polluter celebrities in 2022
6) [x] Decomposition of world emission by industry sectors
7) [x] Total Decomposition with treemapify (14_AV_adv_plots_p1)

# Final polish:
1) [X] Land and ocean temperature plots
2) [X] Heat map of difference of global land and ocean temperatures from the mean
3) [X] World map with total CO2 emissions by country
4) [X] Barplot of biggest polluter countries in 2021
5) [X] Barplot of biggest polluter celebrities in 2022
6) [X] Decomposition of world emission by industry sectors
7) [X] Total Decomposition with treemapify (14_AV_adv_plots_p1)

# It's getting hot in here - Climate Change in Numbers
This repository contains plots for visualisation project for Advanced Visualisation in R classes for winter semester of 2022. Project is set on visualising climate change through numbers of human contribution. Data sources are listed below. 

# To-Do list:
0) [x] Gather data for plots
0) [ ] Opening slide word cloud that spells "Climate change"
1) [x] Land and ocean temperature plots
2) [x] Heat map of difference of global land and ocean temperatures from the mean
3) [x] World map with total CO2 emissions by country
4) [x] Barplot of biggest polluter countries in 2021
5) [x] Barplot of biggest polluter celebrities in 2022
6) [x] Decomposition of world emission by industry sectors
7) [ ] Total Decomposition with treemapify (14_AV_adv_plots_p1)
8) [ ] Arctic sea ice sheet coverage (with animations)
9) [ ] Melting area of ice in arctic (with animations)

# Final polish:
1) [ ] Land and ocean temperature plots
2) [x] Heat map of difference of global land and ocean temperatures from the mean
3) [ ] World map with total CO2 emissions by country
4) [ ] Barplot of biggest polluter countries in 2021
5) [ ] Barplot of biggest polluter celebrities in 2022
6) [ ] Decomposition of world emission by industry sectors
7) [ ] Total Decomposition with treemapify (14_AV_adv_plots_p1)
8) [ ] Arctic sea ice sheet coverage (with animations)
9) [ ] Melting area of ice in arctic (with animations)

# To-Do list:
0) [x] Gather data for plots
1) [ ] Opening slide word cloud that spells "Climate change"
2) [x] World map with total CO2 emissions by country
3) [ ] Barplot of biggest polluter countries in 2021
4) [ ] Barplot of biggest polluter celebrities in 2022
5) [ ] Decomposition of world emission by industry sectors
6) [ ] Arctic ice sheet coverage (with animations)
7) [ ] Melting area of ice in arctic (with animations)

# Final polish:
1) [ ] World map with total CO2 emissions by country
2) [ ] Barplot of biggest polluter countries in 2021
3) [ ] Barplot of biggest polluter celebrities in 2022
4) [ ] Decomposition of world emission by industry sectors
5) [ ] Arctic ice sheet coverage (with animations)
6) [ ] Melting area of ice in arctic (with animations)
